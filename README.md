🚀 THIRAN – Self‑Discovery & Career Alignment Platform
THIRAN is a career guidance and job‑matching platform that helps individuals understand themselves first — their skills, interests, and aptitude — and then aligns them with suitable careers, learning paths, and job opportunities.

🧩 Problem Statement
People often lack a structured and reliable way to understand their skills, interests, and abilities, leading to confusion in choosing the right career path and job opportunities.

💡 Solution Overview
THIRAN solves this problem through a self‑analysis‑first approach.
Instead of directly pushing jobs or courses, the platform:

Evaluates users through psychometric assessments

Validates skills via resume‑based questioning

Compares assessment results with resume claims

Provides explainable insights, career guidance, and job matches

This makes career decisions more confident, realistic, and data‑driven.
